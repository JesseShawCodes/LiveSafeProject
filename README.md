# LiveSafe Full Stack Assignment

The purpose of this is to get a small sample of some of your work, and have something
concrete to discuss next time we see you.

We respect and appreciate your time: please do not spend more than a couple hours on
this. Feel free to turn in what you have at the end of that time, and provide a brief explanation of
what you would do next, given more time.

To get started and submit your work.

* Clone this project from this private repository and complete the assignment as instructed in

[Assignment.md](Assignment.md)

* When ready to submit create a patch of your work. (Ex: git diff origin/master master > mypatch.patch)

* Email the mypatch.patch file back to the LiveSafe staff that sent the assignment
